# pipeline

Creating a functional pipeline for automation of metabolomics predictions.

**Necessary checks to do:**
Functionality of pipeline with 1) all tasks 2) each task alone

Functionality of pipeline with elastic net and new extra models

Additional visualization

**Possible additions to be made:**

VAE preprocessing with scvi

New models for predictions (GNN, VAE, other)
